= Neo4j Procedure Template
:branch: 3.3
:root: https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-procedure-template/blob/{branch}/src

This project is an com.aaman.neo4j you can use to build user defined procedures, functions and aggregation functions in Neo4j.
It contains two procedures, for reading and updating a full-text index.

To try this out, simply clone this repository and have a look at the source and test code (including Test-Server-Setup).

[Note]
This project requires a Neo4j {branch}.x dependency.


=== User Defined Procedure

The user defined procedure allows you to index and search a explicit Lucene index within Neo4j.

Given properties of a node can be added to indexes named according to the labels of the node.
After that the data can be searched with Lucene Syntax.

See link:{root}/main/java/com.aaman.neo4j/FullTextIndex.java[`FullTextIndex.java`] and the link:{root}/test/java/com.aaman.neo4j/LegacyFullTextIndexTest.java[`LegacyFullTextIndexTest.java`].

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person)
CALL com.aaman.neo4j.index(id(n), ['name']);

CALL com.aaman.neo4j.search('Person','name:Jo*') YIELD nodeId
----

=== User Defined Function

The user defined function is a simple join function that joins a list of strings using a delimiter.

See link:{root}/main/java/com.aaman.neo4j/Join.java[`Join.java`] and the link:{root}/test/java/com.aaman.neo4j/JoinTest.java[`JoinTest.java`].

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN com.aaman.neo4j.join(['A','quick','brown','fox'],' ') as sentence
----

=== User Defined Aggregation Function

The aggregation function `com.aaman.neo4j.last` returns the last row of an aggregation.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person)
WITH n ORDER BY n.born
RETURN n.born, com.aaman.neo4j.last(n) as last
----

See link:{root}/main/java/com.aaman.neo4j/Last.java[`Last.java`] and the link:{root}/test/java/com.aaman.neo4j/LastTest.java[`LastTest.java`].

== Building

This project uses maven, to build a jar-file with the procedure in this
project, simply package the project with maven:

    mvn clean package

This will produce a jar-file,`target/procedure-template-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`,
that can be deployed in the `plugin` directory of your Neo4j instance.
